Welcome to the ECSE 321 - Fall 2019 project - Group 3 edition.

Please check the wiki for information on the architecture of the system and how to use it.

## Scope of Project

The TutorME application is designed to cater the tutoring needs of the students at the high school, CÃ‰GEP, and university levels.
The application shall allow a mixture of students, tutors to interact in order to accommodate the students' needs for a particular course, subject or even tutor; all under the company manager's supervison. The scope of the software engineering group project of the Fall 2019 offering of ECSE321 is to develop the software system for a tutoring app. The project is organized in four Agile sprints. The final deliverable consists of an Android app and a website for the Manager viewpoint of the mentioned tutoring app. It should allow the manager to manage tutors and students, book rooms for lessons, add courses, subjects and universities. The project scope also includes a persistence layer to save and load all the necessary data into a database.

Our application supports the scenarios described in the user stories for the Company Manager.
Additionally this application is designed to integrate with the viewpoints of other stake-holders created by seperate teams via service calls. All functionality of the system is to be accessible via the web frontend for respective stakeholders. In addition, a mobile (Android) frontend allows easy execution of the most important functionality for the given stakeholder having both read and write access to the backend via RESTful service call.
